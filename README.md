# AnnoyoBot
### Support completely stopped since the Discord Hack Week ended.
### About:
Here is my bot submission for the Discord Hack Week, I tried to come up with as many things I could imagine, that fits to this bot. You might have noticed the name of this bot speaks for itself **(annoyo = annoying)**. Since I'm applying for the section "shitpost" and the description of it was "Something silly or off-the-wall" I tried to make this bot something unique or maybe you will never see, because who wants a bot that sometimes doesn't exectue your commands, just because it is too selfish?

In the next two sections of this **readme.md** you can learn about the stuff this bot can do and how to setup it up, if you want to use/try it for yourself. Special thanks to anyone that helped me to come up with ideas/features for this bot and where I can improve stuff.

### Features:
* !mute [@user]¹
  * 99% chance to remove all roles from you and give you a role that hides all text and voice channels for 24h or with 1% probability the user you targeted 
* !pat [@user]¹
  * A random anime pat gif will be sent 
* !hug [@user]¹
  * A random anime hug gif will be sent
* !useless¹
  * Will send a useless website into the text channel
* !meme¹
  * Get a random meme from r/dankmemes (new section)
* !help [optional: command]
  * No 50% chance to activate this command, but the commands shown are always random and 3 out of 4 are fake commands, some of the fake commands even have a help page to fool the user!
* !someone
  * Tags a random user on the server, no 50% chance, since it's there to annoy others :^) (1h cooldown for each user respectively)  
* **Automated events**
  * Send random fact (dog, cat, panda), rename a random text channel or send a shower thought as tts (3mins cooldown)
  * Mentioning a random user and send him a Pepo, because we all need Pepo in our life (greate for profile pictures) (1h cooldown)

**¹Chance to use one of those commands is 50%, because AnnoyoBot is selfish**
